Data Warehousing & Mining using MongoDB
Final year Project by Koustuv Sinha & Hitesh Agarwal, Institute of Engineering & Management, under the guidance of Prof. Ee-Kian Wong

MongoDB Introduction
MongoDB is a document database that provides high performance, high availability, and easy scalability.

Document Database
•	Documents (objects) map nicely to programming language data types.
•	Embedded documents and arrays reduce need for joins.
•	Dynamic schema makes polymorphism easier.
High Performance
•	Embedding makes reads and writes fast.
•	Indexes can include keys from embedded documents and arrays.
•	Optional streaming writes (no acknowledgments).
High Availability
•	Replicated servers with automatic master failover.
Easy Scalability
•	Automatic sharding distributes collection data across machines.
•	Eventually-consistent reads can be distributed over replicated servers.

Development Platform
We use Java as the primary development language. The Java drivers for MongoDB are found in http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/java/
